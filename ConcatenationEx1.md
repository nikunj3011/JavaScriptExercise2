# Concatenation Exercise

Create a new file called concatenation-ex1.js.

```c#
console.log('Web and Mobile Application development was the program Fred entered in the Fall of 2019.'); 
console.log('Intro to Programming is going to be the course Fred likes best.  Fred is going to study very hard.');  
console.log('Each night Fred is going to spend time reviewing all of the course material.');  
console.log('Fred will be committed to learning as much as possible about C# in 2019!'); 
```
1. Modify the above code so that instead of having each line in a separate console.log statement, create a variable to store **all** of the text, and then write the value of the variable to the console.  Each of the sentences above should be on a new line.  Ensure that someone looking at your code will be able to read it easily and not have to horizontally scroll.

2. Create a variable to store "Fred", and then replace each instance of "Fred" with the variable.  Use + operator to concatenate. 

3. Repeat number 2, but this time use template literals to do the concatenation.

6. Log the contents of your variable to the console.  The output should look like this:

   Fred was excited about starting his course at NBCC.

   Web and Mobile Application development was the program Fred entered in the Fall of 2019.

   Intro to Programming is going to be the course Fred likes best.  Fred is going to study very hard.

   Each night Fred is going to spend time reviewing all of the course material.

   Fred will be committed to learning as much as possible about C# in 2019!
